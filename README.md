# Starshippers

How to build this iOS app:
- On a Mac, run the App Store app.
- In the Mac OS App Store app, do a search for Xcode (it’s free) and download and install it.
- Open Xcode, and select Open from the File menu.
- Browse to the Starshippers/Starshippers.xcodeproj file and open it.
- After the project is open, select a device from the iOS Simulator list at the top of the Xcode window (next to “Starshippers >”). For example, iPhone 6s.
- Press the Run button at the top left of the Xcode window.

Notes:
- I put tags on some of the commits showing how much time had passed since starting the project. For example, commit 30bbe6 (“2Hrs”) was the two-hour marker.
- I added a couple commits at 2:20 and 2:30 just because these things were quick once the main app functionality (requesting API data and displaying it) was working. Any commits after that were just because I don't like to leave things unfinished. :)

Next Steps:
- I added a “coming soon” image as a placeholder for where I wanted to do a programmatic Google image search for “Star Wars starship_name” (where starship_name is the name of the specific ship) and display the first resulting image.
- Show a scrollable list of pilot names on the starship detail screen.
- Add all remaining starship fields to the starship detail screen.
